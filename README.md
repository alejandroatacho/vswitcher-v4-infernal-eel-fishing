# Main requirement:
- Oily Fishing Rod
- Ice Gloves (Very important or you can't interact with the eels)
- Bait (normal fishing bait)
- A Hammer (To break the eels)
- Dragon harpoon (optional, if you comment out my UseSpecialAttack() line in the code.)
- Lightbearer Ring (optional)

# Guide
Gametick trigger: 3
anti-ban delay: 50, 100 (change this to what you want, this will decide the speed your gonna use knife on eel).


# Crucial
- Make sure your last inventory spot is always open for eels that way it will smash with the hammer the eel like we are doing blood runecrafting zeah fast method. (check image below if you don't understand)

# Fishing Spot Reason (South - East)
The fishing spot we are fishing at is the best spot, it has by default more then 2 fish spots compare to the rest and the chance of waiting for a spot to come back is almost none existent.

### Setup
1. Copy the provided Java code into your code editor trigger v4.
2. Save the file with an appropriate name.

### Usage
1. Start the script in the fishing area where you want to fish.
2. Ensure you have the necessary items and equipment equipped for fishing.
3. The script will perform the following actions:

   - Use special attack if enough special energy is available.
   - Enable running if the player's energy is full.
   - Bait the fishing spot if the inventory is not full and the player is not moving.
   - Convert Sacred Eels to Rewards if the inventory is full, the player is not moving, and Infernal Eels are present in the inventory. The script will loop through the conversion process until all Infernal Eels are converted.
   - If the inventory is not full or there are no Infernal eels, the script will continue baiting the fishing spot.
